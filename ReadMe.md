- 👋 Hello! My name is Donovan Martell, a 19 y/o student at Cascades Job Corps.
- 👀 I am heavily interested in physics and computer science. I have written some scripts in my time here, and I'll be posting a few.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my HSD and Google's IT Automation with Python. Acquired GED in October, Comptia A+ in January, and Linux+ in July.
- 💞️ Collaboration would be wonderful, I'm always down for learning/teaching opportunities. 
- 📫 You can reach out to me at donovanvmartell@gmail.com for any reason!
